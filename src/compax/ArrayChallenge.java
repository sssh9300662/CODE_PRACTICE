/**
 * Take the array of positive integers stored in arr and perform the following algorithm:
 * continuously get the difference of adjacent integers to create a new array of integers,
 * then do the same for the new array until a single number is left and return that number.
 * For example: if arr is [4, 5, 1, 2, 7] then taking the difference of each pair of elements produces
 * the following new array: [1, 4, 1, 5]. Then do the same for this new array to produce [3, 3, 4] -> [0, 1] -> 1.
 * So for this example your program should return the number 1 because that is whatâ€™s left at the end.
